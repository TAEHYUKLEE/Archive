        <p class="description_data"> &nbsp <b>Description</b>: Using R-script, We analyzed data to find out whether people's choice of late-night meals changes depending on the weather.
            The final goal is to optimize customer service according to the weather forecast.
            Late-night meal data(from SKT big Hub) consist of variables such as pizza, chicken, and balck-noodles, etc. and weather data consist of precipitation, temperature, air pressure, and wind direction, etc. were collected.
            Correlation analysis(a) and cluster analysis(b) were performed with the weather variable as the independent variable and the late-night meal menu as the dependent variable.
            In conclusion, although no correlation was found, it was the first data analysis project that let me understand the importance of sharing role and the potential of data in Data Analysis Works.
